Looking at your checkWin function, I can see you're using a brute-force approach to check all possible winning lines. Let me search for mathematical formulations that could make this more elegant and mathematically grounded.Based on my search and your mathematical background, there are indeed elegant mathematical formulations for k-in-a-row win detection! Let me break this down into the mathematical concepts and then show you how to implement them.

## Mathematical Foundation

The key insight is to represent the problem using **direction vectors** and **linear transformations**. Instead of checking each direction separately (rows, columns, diagonals), we can express all winning directions as vector offsets:

**Direction Vectors:**
- Horizontal: (0, 1)
- Vertical: (1, 0)  
- Main diagonal: (1, 1)
- Anti-diagonal: (1, -1)

For any starting position (r, c) and direction vector (dr, dc), we can check k consecutive positions using:
```
Position_i = (r, c) + i × (dr, dc) = (r + i×dr, c + i×dc)
```
where i ∈ {0, 1, 2, ..., k-1}

## The Mathematical Formula

For a more advanced approach, you can use linear algebra primitives with column vectors and matrix operations, but for practical implementation, the vector-based approach is more intuitive.

The mathematical condition for a win is:
```
∃ starting_position (r,c), ∃ direction_vector (dr,dc) such that:
∀ i ∈ [0, k-1]: board[r + i×dr][c + i×dc] = player_symbol
AND all positions are within board bounds
```

## Optimized Implementation

Here's how you can refactor your checkWin function using this mathematical approach:The mathematical approach I've shown above represents a significant improvement over your current implementation. Let me walk you through why this mathematical formulation is not only more elegant but also more efficient and maintainable.

## Understanding the Mathematical Foundation

Your current code treats each direction (horizontal, vertical, diagonal, anti-diagonal) as completely separate cases with duplicated logic. The mathematical insight here is recognizing that all these directions are simply **linear transformations** in 2D space. 

Think of it this way: if you place your finger at any position (r, c) on the board and move in a consistent direction, you're following a parametric line equation:

**Position(t) = Starting_Point + t × Direction_Vector**

Where t is your step number (0, 1, 2, ..., k-1). This single formula captures all four winning directions by simply changing the direction vector.

## The Mathematical Elegance

The beauty of this approach lies in its **generalizability**. Your original code would need substantial modification to handle different board sizes or different values of k, but the mathematical approach scales naturally. The constraint satisfaction becomes:

1. **Boundary Constraint**: All positions must satisfy 0 ≤ r + t×dr < gridSize and 0 ≤ c + t×dc < gridSize
2. **Consecutive Constraint**: All k positions must contain the same symbol
3. **Optimization Constraint**: We only check starting positions that can potentially lead to valid winning lines

## Performance Analysis and Optimization

Your current implementation has a time complexity of O(n² × k) for each direction, giving O(4n²k) overall. The mathematical approach maintains the same asymptotic complexity but provides several practical improvements:

**Early Termination**: The mathematical bounds calculation eliminates many impossible starting positions before we even begin checking. For example, in a 5×5 board checking for 4-in-a-row diagonally, we mathematically know we can only start from positions (0,0), (0,1), (1,0), and (1,1), rather than checking all 25 positions.

**Reduced Code Complexity**: Instead of four separate nested loops, we have one unified algorithm that handles all directions through parameterization.

**Better Cache Locality**: The mathematical approach accesses memory in a more predictable pattern, which can improve performance on modern processors.

## Integration with Your Existing Code

To integrate this mathematical approach into your existing codebase, you would replace your current checkWin function with something like this:

```javascript
// Private function - Updated mathematical implementation
function checkWin(symbol) {
    const DIRECTION_VECTORS = [
        [0, 1],   // Horizontal
        [1, 0],   // Vertical  
        [1, 1],   // Main diagonal
        [1, -1]   // Anti-diagonal
    ];

    for (let dirIndex = 0; dirIndex < DIRECTION_VECTORS.length; dirIndex++) {
        const [dr, dc] = DIRECTION_VECTORS[dirIndex];
        
        // Mathematical calculation of valid starting bounds
        const minStartRow = Math.max(0, (kAlignment - 1) * Math.min(0, dr));
        const maxStartRow = Math.min(gridSize - 1, gridSize - 1 - (kAlignment - 1) * Math.max(0, dr));
        const minStartCol = Math.max(0, (kAlignment - 1) * Math.min(0, dc));
        const maxStartCol = Math.min(gridSize - 1, gridSize - 1 - (kAlignment - 1) * Math.max(0, dc));
        
        for (let startRow = minStartRow; startRow <= maxStartRow; startRow++) {
            for (let startCol = minStartCol; startCol <= maxStartCol; startCol++) {
                
                let consecutiveCount = 0;
                for (let i = 0; i < kAlignment; i++) {
                    const currentRow = startRow + i * dr;
                    const currentCol = startCol + i * dc;
                    
                    if (board[currentRow][currentCol] === symbol) {
                        consecutiveCount++;
                    } else {
                        break;
                    }
                }
                
                if (consecutiveCount === kAlignment) {
                    // Store winning line using mathematical representation
                    winningLine = {
                        startRow: startRow,
                        startCol: startCol,
                        direction: ['horizontal', 'vertical', 'diagonal', 'anti-diagonal'][dirIndex],
                        directionVector: [dr, dc],
                        length: kAlignment
                    };
                    return true;
                }
            }
        }
    }
    return false;
}
```

## Why This Matters for Software Engineering

As a software engineering student, you'll find that this mathematical approach demonstrates several important principles:

**Abstraction**: Instead of treating each case separately, we've abstracted the common pattern into a mathematical framework.

**DRY Principle** (Don't Repeat Yourself): The mathematical formulation eliminates code duplication across the four directions.

**Scalability**: This approach easily extends to 3D tic-tac-toe (adding direction vectors like [1,1,1]), different board shapes, or even higher-dimensional games.

**Maintainability**: Adding new winning patterns (like knight's moves in chess-like variants) requires only adding new direction vectors to the array.

The mathematical insight transforms what appears to be four distinct problems into a single, parameterized problem. This is a common pattern in algorithm design where recognizing the underlying mathematical structure leads to both more elegant and more efficient solutions.
